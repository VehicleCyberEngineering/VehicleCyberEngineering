Vehicle Cyber Engineering Lab

Welcome to the Vehicle Cyber Engineering Lab's GitHub Profile!

About Us

The Vehicle Cyber Engineering Lab is dedicated to advancing the field of vehicle cybersecurity, with a specific focus on truck cybersecurity. Our mission is to explore, innovate, and develop cutting-edge solutions to protect modern vehicles from cyber threats. We conduct rigorous experiments and research to enhance the security of automotive systems, ensuring safety and resilience in the face of evolving cyber challenges.

What We Do

Our lab engages in a variety of research activities and experiments aimed at understanding and mitigating cybersecurity risks in trucks. This includes:
(
Vulnerability Assessments: Identifying and analyzing potential security weaknesses in truck electronic control units (ECUs) and communication networks.
Penetration Testing: Simulating cyber-attacks to evaluate the resilience of truck systems and develop effective defense mechanisms.
Security Protocols: Developing and testing new security protocols and encryption techniques tailored for automotive applications.
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Creating and deploying IDS to detect and respond to potential cyber threats in real-time.
Collaboration and Open Source: Working with industry partners, academic institutions, and the open-source community to share knowledge and foster innovation in vehicle cybersecurity.
